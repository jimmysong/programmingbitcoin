== Finite Fields

Learning about new mathematical structures can be a bit intimidating and in this chapter, I hope to dispel the myth that high level math is super difficult. Finite Fields, in particular, actually don't require all that much in terms of knowledge than, say High School level math.

Think of Finite Fields as something that you could have learned in High School instead of Trigonomotry, just that the education system you're a part of decided that Trigonomotry was more important for you to learn.

In any case, this is my way of telling you that Finite Fields are not that hard to learn and require no more background than what you knew by your second year in High School.

=== Finite Field Definition

Mathematically, a Finite Field is defined as follows:

A finite set of numbers and two operations *+* (addition) and *⋅* (multiplication) that satisfy the following:

* if *a* and *b* are in the set, *a+b* and *a⋅b* is in the set. We call this property _closed_
* if *a* is in the set, *-a* is in the set, or what we call the _additive inverse_.
* if *a* is in the set and is not 0, *a^-1^* is in the set, or what we call the _multiplicative inverse_.

Let's unpack each of the following.

We have a set of numbers that's finite. Because the set is finite, we can designate a number *p* which is how big the set is. This is what we call the _order_ of the set. 

The second part is that we are closed under addition and multiplication. This means that we have to define addition and multiplication in a way as to not go over *p-1*. We'll get to how exactly we define addition and multiplication later, but the key concept here to learn is that we can *define addition and subtraction differently than the traditional addition and subtraction*.

The third part is that we have the additive inverse. That is, if *a* is in the set, *-a* is in the set. Using this, we can define subtraction. Subtraction is the inverse of addition. Once again, we have to make sure subtraction is defined in a way as to not go under 0. We will define subtraction specifically to a finite field.

The fourth part is that we have the multiplicative inverse. That is, if *a* is in the set, *a^-1^* is in the set. That is *a⋅a^-1^=1*. Using this, we can define division, the inverse of multiplication. This will be the trickiest to define in a finite field, but we will do so.

=== Defining Finite Sets

If the order (or size) of the set is *p*, we can call the elements of the set, 0, 1, 2, ... p-1. In classical math notation this looks like:

F~p~ = {0, 1, 2, ... p-1}

The field is defined by what's in the field. In this case a bunch of numbers. That's what F~p~ is, we call a specific finite field "field of 13" or "field of 28" or whatever the size of it is (again, the size is what mathematicians call _order_). The numbers between the {}`s represent what elements are in the field. We name the elements 0, 1, 2, etc because they're convenient for our purposes. 

A Finite Field of order 8 looks like this:

F~8~ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

A Finite Field of order 17 would look like this:

F~17~= {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}

A Finite Field of order 981

F~981~= {0, 1, 2, ... 980}

Notice the order of the field is always 1 more than the largest element.

=== Modulo Arithmetic

We can define addition on the finite set using something called modulo arithmetic. Modulo arithmetic is something you probably did back in elementary school. Remember problems like this?


TODO: Put long division image


Whenever the division wasn't even, there was something called the "remainder" which is the leftover from the actual division. We can actually define modulo in the same way. We use the operator *%* for "modulo".

7 % 3 = 1

Because

TODO: Put long division image

We can do the same for larger numbers:

1747 % 241 = 60

If it helps, you can think of modulo arithmetic as "wrap-around" or "clock" math. Imagine a problem like this:

It is currently 3 o'clock. What hour will it be 47 hours from now?

The answer is 2 o'clock because:

(3 + 47) % 12 = 2

We can also see this as "wrapping around" in the sense that you go back to zero every time we move ahead 12 hours.

We can also do modulo on negative numbers. For example, you can ask:

It is currently 3 o'clock. What hour was it 16 hours ago?

The answer is 11 o'clock. Hence we can say:

(3 - 16) % 12 = 11

The minute hand is also a modulo operation. For example, you can ask:

It is currently 12 minutes past the hour. What minute will it be 843 minutes from now?

(12 + 843) % 60 = 15

It will be 15 minutes past the hour. Likewise, we can ask:

It is currently 23 minutes past the hour. What minute will it be 97 minutes from now?

(23 + 97) % 60 = 0

0 is another way of saying there is no remainder.

Essentially the result of the modulo (%) operation is always between 0 and 59, inclusive, in this case. This happens to be a very useful property as even very large numbers can be brought down to size with modulo:

14738495684013 % 60 = 33

We'll be using modulo as we define field arithmetic.

=== Finite Field Addition and Subtraction

Remember that we need to define Finite Field addition in a way as to make sure that the result is still in the set. That is, we want to make sure that addition in a Finite Field is *closed*.

We can utilize what we just learned, modulo arithmetic, to make addition work. Let's say we have a Finite Field of 19:

F~19~={0,1,2,...18}, where a, b ∈ F~19~

Addition being closed means:

a+~f~b ∈ F~19~

We denote finite field addition with +~f~ to avoid confusion with the normal integer addition +.

If we utilize modulo arithmetic, we can guarantee this to be the case. We can define a+~f~b this way:

a+~f~b = (a+b)%19

For example:

7+~f~8 = (7+8)%19 = 15

11+~f~17 = (11+17)%19 = 9

and so on.

This should be somewhat intuitive. We take any two numbers in the set, add and "wrap around" the end to get the sum. We are creating our own addition operator here and it's a bit unintuitive. After all 11 +~f~ 17 = 9 just doesn't look right for most people because they're not used to Finite Field addition.

More generally, we can define field addition this way:

a, b ∈ F~p~, a+~f~b = (a+b)%p

We can also define the additive inverse this way.

a ∈ F~p~ implies that -~p~a ∈ F~p~

-~f~a = (-a) % p

Again, for clarity, we use -~f~ to distinguish field subtraction and negation from integer subtraction and negation.

In F~19~:

-9 = (-9) % 19 = 10

Which means that:

9 +~f~ 10 = 0

And that turns out to be true.

Similarly, we can do field subtraction.

a, b ∈ F~p~, a-~f~b = (a-b)%p

In F~19~:

11-~f~9=(11-9)%19=2

6-~f~13=(6-13)%19=12

and so on.

==== Exercise 1

Solve these problems in F~57~

44+~f~33
9-~f~29
17+~f~42+~f~49
52-~f~30-~f~38



=== Finite Field Multiplication and Exponentiation

Just as we defined a new addition (+~f~) for Finite Fields that was _closed_, we can also define a new multiplication for Finite Fields that's also closed. By multiplying the same number many times, we can also define exponentiation or power. In this section, we'll go through exactly how to define this using modulo arithmetic.

As you most likely learned in elementary school, multiplication is simply adding a number many times.

5⋅3 = 5+5+5 = 15
8⋅17 = 8+8+8+...(17 total 8's)...+8 = 136

We can define multiplication on a Finite Field the same way. Operating in F~19~ once again,

5⋅~f~3 = 5+~f~5+~f~5
8⋅~f~17 = 8+~f~8+~f~8+~f~...(17 total 8's)...+~f~8

We already know how to do the right side, and that yields a number within the F~19~ set:

5⋅~f~3 = 5+~f~5+~f~5 = 15 % 19 = 15
8⋅~f~17 = 8+~f~8+~f~8+~f~...(17 total 8's)...+~f~8 = (8⋅17) % 19 = 136 % 19 = 3

Note that the second result is pretty unintuitive. We don't normally think of 8⋅17 as 3, but that's part of what's necessary in order to define multiplication in a way that's closed. That is, the result of field multiplication is always in the set {0,1,...18}.

Exponentiation is simply multiplying a number many times.
