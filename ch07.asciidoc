== Transaction Creation and Validation

[.lead]
One of the trickiest things for a transaction is the process of validating a transaction. Closely following that is the act of creating the transaction itself. In this chapter, we'll cover the exact steps to validating a transaction and then creating one for ourselves.

=== Validating Transactions

Every node, when receiving transactions makes sure that the transaction adheres to the network rules. This process is called _transaction validation_. Here are the main things that a node needs to check for:

* Inputs of the transaction are previously unspent
* Sum of the inputs > sum of the outputs
* scriptSig actually unlocks the previous scriptPubKey

The first aspect prevents double-spending. Any input that's already been spent cannot be spent again.

The second aspect makes sure no new Bitcoins are created (except in a special transaction called the coinbase transaction. More on that in Chapter 9).

The third aspect makes sure that the smart contract resolves to True. In the vast majority of transactions, this means checking that the one or more signatures in the ScriptSig are valid.

Let's look at how each is done.

=== Checking the spentness of inputs

In order to prevent double-spending, each input has to be checked to see if it's previously been spent. In order to check that this input has *not* been used in any other transaction, we actually need access to the entire blockchain. We cannot glean from the transaction itself whether it's valid or not, no more than we can look at a personal check and determine whether that's overdrafting or not. The only way to know is to look at the entire set of transactions.

In Bitcoin, we can determine whether an input is being double spent by keeping track of the unspent transaction outputs (aka UTXOs, see Chapter 5). If an input is in the UTXO set, the transaction is NOT double-spending. If the transaction passes the rest of the validity tests, then we remove all the inputs of the transaction from the UTXO set. Light clients that do not have access to the blockchain have to trust other nodes for their information, including input spentness information.

A full node can check the spentness of an input pretty easily, a light node has to get this information from someone else.

=== Checking the sum of the inputs vs the sum of the outputs

The second part of the validation is making sure that the input sum is greater than or equal to the output sum. This ensures that the transaction does not create new coins. The one exception is a Coinbase transaction which we'll talk more about in the Chapter 9. The inputs don't have an amount, so this must be looked up on the blockchain. Once again, full nodes will have access to the amounts associated with the unspent output, but light nodes will have to depend on full nodes to supply this information.

We covered how to calculate fees in Chapter 5. This validation step is essentially the same as checking that the fee is not negative (that is, creating money). Recall the last exercise in Chapter 5. The answer should have looked something like this:

[source,python]
----
class Tx:
    ...
    def fee(self, testnet=False):
        '''Returns the fee of this transaction in satoshi'''
        # initialize input sum and output sum
        input_sum, output_sum = 0, 0
        # iterate through inputs
        for tx_in in self.tx_ins:
            # for each input get the value and add to input sum
            input_sum += tx_in.amount(testnet=testnet)
        # iterate through outputs
        for tx_out in self.tx_outs:
            # for each output get the amount and add to output sum
            output_sum += tx_out.amount
        # return input sum - output sum
        return input_sum - output_sum
----

We can test to see if this transaction is trying to print money by utilizing this method:

[source,python]
----
>>> from tx import Tx
>>> from io import BytesIO
>>> stream = BytesIO(bytes.fromhex('010000...0600'))
>>> transaction = Tx.parse(stream)
>>> print(transaction.fee() >= 0)
True
----

If the fee is negative, we know that the `output_sum` is greater than the `input_sum`, which is another way of saying that this transaction is trying to create money out of thin air.

=== Checking the Signature

Perhaps the trickiest part of validating a transaction is the process of checking its signatures. A transaction typically has at least one signature per input. If there are multisig outputs being spent, there may be more. As we learned in Chapter 3, the ECDSA signature algorithm requires that for each input, we need the public key (P), the signature hash (z), and the Signature (r,s). Once these are determined, the process of verifying the signature is pretty simple as we already coded in Chapter 3:

[source,python]
----
>>> from ecc import S256Point, Signature
>>> sec = bytes.fromhex('0349fc4e631e3624a545de3f89f5d8684c7b8138bd94bdd531d2e213bf016b278a')
>>> der = bytes.fromhex('3045022100ed81ff192e75a3fd2304004dcadb746fa5e24c5031ccfcf21320b0277457c98f02207a986d955c6e0cb35d446a89d3f56100f4d7f67801c31967743a9c8e10615bed')
>>> z = 0x27e0c5994dec7824e56dec6b2fcb342eb7cdb0d0957c2fce9882f715e85d81a6
>>> point = S256Point.parse(sec)
>>> signature = Signature.parse(der)
>>> print(point.verify(z, signature))
True
----

The sec and der formats make getting the P, r and s pretty simple. The hard part is getting the actual signature hash (z). You would think that this would be easy since you can just hash the transaction. But you can't do that since the signature itself is part of the ScriptSig and a signature can't sign itself.

image::validation1.png[Validation Start]

Instead, what you need to do is to modify the transaction before actually signing it. That is, you have to compute the z in a very particular way. The procedure is as follows.

==== Step 1: Empty all the ScriptSigs

The first step is to empty all the ScriptSigs when checking the signature. The same procedure is used for creating the signature, except the ScriptSigs are usually already empty.

image::validation2.png[Validation Step 1]

==== Step 2: Replace the ScriptSig of the input being signed with the previous ScriptPubKey

Each input points to a previous transaction output, which itself has a ScriptPubKey. We take this ScriptPubKey and put that in place of the empty ScriptSig. You would think that this would require a lookup on the blockchain, and this may be the case. In practice, you already know the ScriptPubKey as the input was chosen as one where you have the private key to unlock it. Therefore, you know the address it was sent to and thus, the ScriptPubKey.

image::validation3.png[Validation Step 2]

==== Step 3: Append the hash type

Lastly, we add a 4-byte hash type to the end. This is to specify what the signature is authorizing. The signature can authorize that this input has to go with all the other inputs and outputs (SIGHASH_ALL), go with a specific output (SIGHASH_SINGLE) or go with none of the outputs (SIGHASH_NONE). The latter two have some theoretical use cases, but in practice, almost every transaction is signed with SIGHASH_ALL. That is, the entire transaction has to go through, or the input signature is invalid.

The integer corresponding to SIGHASH_ALL is 1 and this has to be encoded in little-endian over 4 bytes, which makes the transaction look like this:

image::validation4.png[Validation Step 3]

The double_sha256 of this interpreted as a big-endian integer is our z. The code for getting our z looks like this:

[source,python]
----
>>> from helper import double_sha256
>>> blob = bytes.fromhex('01000000...01000000')
>>> d256 = double_sha256(blob)
>>> z = int.from_bytes(d256, 'big')
0x27e0c5994dec7824e56dec6b2fcb342eb7cdb0d0957c2fce9882f715e85d81a6
----

Now that we have our z, we can take the public key in SEC format and the signature in DER format from the script sig to verify the signature.

[source,python]
----
>>> from ecc import S256Point, Signature
>>> sec = bytes.fromhex('0349...8a')
>>> der = bytes.fromhex('3045...ed')
>>> z = 0x27e0c5994dec7824e56dec6b2fcb342eb7cdb0d0957c2fce9882f715e85d81a6  # <1>
>>> point = S256Point.parse(sec)
>>> signature = Signature.parse(der)
>>> point.verify(z, signature)
True
----
<1> z is from the code above

We can now make this process into a method of `Tx`.

==== Exercise {counter:exercise}

Write the `sig_hash` method for the `Tx` class.

==== Exercise {counter:exercise}

Write the `verify_input` method for the `Tx` class. You will want to utilize the TxIn.der_signature(), TxIn.sec_pubkey() and TxIn.hash_type() methods to make this work.

=== Creating transactions

Once validation of transactions is understood, the creation of transactions is more or less straightforward. The key to making the creation of transactions work is to make sure that all the validations that will be performed act as expected. For example, you will not want to create a transaction where the input amounts are less than the output amounts, creating extra bitcoins. Such transactions won't be valid and trying to propagate them on the network may get you banned by peers.

To create a transaction, you must first have some outputs that have been sent to you. That is, outputs whose ScriptPubKey you can unlock. The vast majority of the time, you will need one or more private keys corresponding to the public keys that are hashed in the ScriptPubKey.

The rest of this chapter will be concerned with creating a transaction whose ScriptPubKey is a p2pkh output.

=== Creating a transaction

The construction of a transaction is most easily done by answering some basic questions:

1. Where do we want the bitcoins to go?
2. What outputs are assigned to our private key(s) that we can spend?
3. How quickly do we want these transactions to get into the blockchain?

We'll be using testnet for this example, though this can easily be applied to mainnet.

The first question is about how much we want to pay whom. We can pay one or more addresses. For the sake of this example, say we want to pay testnet coins to mnrVtF8DWjMu839VW3rBfgYaAfKk8983Xf 0.1 tBTC.

The second question is about what's in our wallet. What do we have available to spend? For the sake of this example, we have an output at this transaction: 0d6fe5213c0b3291f208cba8bfb59b7476dffacc4e5cb66f6eb20a080843a299:13. Looking at a testnet block explorer, our output is worth 0.33 tBTC.

image::txcreation1.png[Transaction seen on the blockchain]

Since this is more than 0.1 tBTC, we'll want to send the rest back to ourselves. Though it's generally bad privacy and security practice to re-use addresses, we'll send the bitcoins back to the same address to make this step easier.

.Why reusing addresses is a bad idea
****
Back in Chapter 6, we went through how p2pk was inferior to p2pkh, in part because it was only protected by ECDSA. p2pkh, on the other hand, is also protected by SHA256 and RIPEMD160. However, if you've already *spent from* an address, you have already revealed your public key as part of the ScriptSig. Once you've revealed that public key, SHA256 and RIPEMD160 no longer protect you as the attacker knows the public key and doesn't have to guess.

That said, you are still protected by the Discrete Log problem, which is unlikely to be broken any time soon, but it's important from a security perspective to understand what you're protected by.

The other reason to not reuse addresses is for privacy. Having a single address for yourself means that people can link your transactions together. If, for example, you bought something private (medication to treat some disease you don't want others to know about) and utilized the same address for a donation to some charity, the charity and the medication vendor would know about each other.

Privacy leaks tend to become security holes over time as bad guys get to know more about you and can thus target you. This is another reason reusing addresses is a bad idea.
****

The third question is really about fees. If we want to get the transaction in faster, we'll want to pay more fees and if we don't mind waiting, we'll want to pay less. In our case, we'll use 0.01 tBTC as our fee.

.Fee Estimation
****
Fee estimation is generally done on a per-byte basis. Roughly speaking, if your transaction is 200 bytes, you'll want to have double the fees as a transaction that's 100 bytes. This is because block space is limited and larger transactions take up more space. This calculation has changed a bit since Segregated Witness (See Chapter 13), but the general principle still applies. You want to pay on a per-byte basis enough so that a miner is motivated to include your transaction.

When blocks aren't full, almost any amount is enough to get your transaction included. However, when blocks are full, this is not an easy thing to estimate. There are multiple ways to estimate fees including:

* Looking at various fee levels and estimating the probability of inclusion based on past blocks.
* Looking at the current mempool and adding a fee that roughly corresponds to enough economic incentivization.
* Going with some fixed fee

Many wallets utilize different strategies and this is an active area of research.

=== Combining to make a transaction

Our plan now laid out. We will have one input and two outputs. But first, let's look at some other tools we'll need.

We first need a way to take an address and get the 20-byte hash out of it. This is the opposite of encoding an address, so we call the function `decode_base58`

[source,python]
----
def decode_base58(s):
    num = 0
    for c in s.encode('ascii'):  # <1>
        num *= 58
        num += BASE58_ALPHABET.index(c)
    combined = num.to_bytes(25, byteorder='big')  # <2>
    checksum = combined[-4:]
    if double_sha256(combined[:-4])[:4] != checksum:
        raise RuntimeError('bad address: {} {}'.format(checksum, double_sha256(combined)[:4]))
    return combined[1:-4]  # <3>
----
<1> We have to figure out first what number is encoded in this base58 address
<2> Once we have the actual integer, we convert it to big-endian bytes
<3> The first byte is the network prefix and the last 4 are the checksum. The middle 20 is the actual 20-byte hash (aka hash160).

The other thing we will need is a way to convert the 20-byte hash to a ScriptPubKey. We call this `p2pkh_script` since we're converting the hash160 to a p2pkh.

[source,python]
----

def p2pkh_script(h160):
    '''Takes a hash160 and returns the scriptPubKey'''
    return Script.parse(b'\x76\xa9\x14' + h160 + b'\x88\xac')
----

Note that `76` is OP_DUP, `a9` is OP_HASH160, `14` is the length of the hash160 (20 bytes in hex), `88` is OP_EQUALVERIFY and `ac` is OP_CHECKSIG. This is exactly the p2pkh ScriptPubKey from Chapter 6.

We can now proceed to create the transaction.

[source,python]
----
>>> from helper import decode_base58, p2pkh_script, SIGHASH_ALL
>>> from script import Script
>>> from tx import TxIn, TxOut, Tx
>>> tx_ins = []
>>> prev_tx = bytes.fromhex('0d6fe5213c0b3291f208cba8bfb59b7476dffacc4e5cb66f6eb20a080843a299')
>>> prev_index = 13
>>> tx_ins.append(TxIn(prev_tx, prev_index, b'', 0xffffffff))
>>> tx_outs = []
>>> change_amount = int(0.33*100000000)  # <1>
>>> change_h160 = decode_base58('mzx5YhAH9kNHtcN481u6WkjeHjYtVeKVh2')
>>> change_script = p2pkh_script(change_h160)
>>> tx_outs.append(TxOut(amount=change_amount, script_pubkey=change_script))
>>> target_amount = int(0.1*100000000)  # <1>
>>> target_h160 = decode_base58('mnrVtF8DWjMu839VW3rBfgYaAfKk8983Xf')
>>> target_script = p2pkh_script(target_h160)
>>> tx_outs.append(TxOut(amount=target_amount, script_pubkey=target_script))
>>> transaction = Tx(1, tx_ins, tx_outs, 0, testnet=True)  # <2>
>>> print(transaction)
version: 1
tx_ins:
0d6fe5213c0b3291f208cba8bfb59b7476dffacc4e5cb66f6eb20a080843a299:13

tx_outs:
33000000:OP_DUP OP_HASH160 d52ad7ca9b3d096a38e752c2018e6fbc40cdf26f OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG 
10000000:OP_DUP OP_HASH160 507b27411ccf7f16f10297de6cef3f291623eddf OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG 

locktime: 0
----
<1> The amount must be in satoshis and given there are 100,000,000 satoshis per BTC, we have to multiply and cast to an integer.
<2> Note we have to designate which network to look up using the `testnet=True` argument.

We have created the actual transaction. However, every ScriptSig in this transaction is currently empty and filling it is where we turn next.

=== Signing a transaction

The actual signing of the transaction is the trickiest part. Thankfully, we know how to get the sig_hash, or the z, from earlier in this chapter. We have to have the private key to actually sign the transaction and signing the z allows us to produce the der signature.

[source,python]
----
>>> from ecc import PrivateKey
>>> from helper import SIGHASH_ALL
>>> hash_type = SIGHASH_ALL
>>> z = transaction.sig_hash(0, hash_type)  # <1>
>>> private_key = PrivateKey(secret=8675309)
>>> der = private_key.sign(z).der()
>>> sig = der + hash_type.to_bytes(1, 'big')  # <2>
>>> sec = private_key.point.sec()
>>> script_sig = Script([sig, sec])  # <3>
>>> transaction.tx_ins[0].script_sig = script_sig   # <4>
>>> print(transaction.serialize().hex())
01000000...00000000
----
<1> We only need to sign the first input as there's only one. Multiple inputs would require us to sign each input with the right private key.
<2> The signature is actually a combination of the der signature and the hash type.
<3> The ScriptSig of a p2pkh from Chapter 6 is exactly two elements: signature and SEC format public key.
<4> Again, we only have that one input that we need to sign, but if there were more, this would need to be done for each.

==== Exercise {counter:exercise}

Write the `sign_input` method for the `Tx` class, which does the above.

==== Creating your own transactions on testnet

The first step to creating your own transactions is to get some coins for yourself. In order to do that you'll need an address. If you completed the exercises in Chapter 4, you should have your own testnet address and private key. If you don't remember, here's how:

[source,python]
----
>>> from ecc import PrivateKey
>>> private_key = PrivateKey(secret=90210)
>>> print(private_key.point.address(testnet=True))
mqNK1JUujDXeufN9bDVKtzzvriqjnZLxHU
----
<1> Please use some secret other than this number

Now that you have an address, you can get some coins at a myriad of testnet faucets. Faucets are where you can get testnet coins for free. You can Google "testnet bitcoin faucet" to find them or use one from this list: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet#Faucets. At the time of this writing, https://testnet.coinfaucet.eu/en/ works. You will want to enter your address as generated above.

After you get some coins, see if you can spend them using the library you've been writing. This is usually a big accomplishment for a budding Bitcoin developer, so please take some time to see if you can complete this exercise.

==== Exercise {counter:exercise}

Create a testnet transaction that sends 60% of a single UTXO to mwJn1YPMq7y5F8J3LkC5Hxg9PHyZ5K4cFv. The remaining amount minus fees should go back to your own change address. This should be a 1 input, 2 output transaction.

==== Exercise {counter:exercise}

Advanced: get some more testnet coins from a testnet faucet and create a 2 input, 1 output transaction. 1 input should be from the faucet, the other should be from the previous exercise, the output can be your own address.

=== Conclusion

We've successfully validated existing transactions on the blockchain and we've also created our own transactions on testnet! This is the very simple case of p2pkh, we'll now turn to a more advanced smart contract on Bitcoin, p2sh.
